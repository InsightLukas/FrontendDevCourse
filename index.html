            </div>
            The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, 
            with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon 
            junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. 
            Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a 
            younger male may be called a cockerel.

                <h2>Beef</h2>
            </div>
            The word beef is from the Latin word bōs,
            in contrast to cow which is from Middle English 
            cou (both words have the same Indo-European root *gʷou-).
            After the Norman Conquest, the French-speaking nobles 
            who ruled England naturally used French words to refer to 
            the meats they were served.
